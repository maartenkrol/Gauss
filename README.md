# Gauss
 
This package presents educational material to explore the Gaussian Plume model, for undergraduate atmospheric sciences students. No real programming experience is needed because the python package ipywidgets is used as an interface. Functionality is buid up step by step, with learning goals:

* Explain the mathematical formulation of the GPM
* Investigate the influence of wind, source strength, and stack height
* Determine concentrations downwind of a stack
* Investigate the influence of the atmospheric stability
* Extend the GPM with terms for ground reflection and line sources

The main document is a python Notebook `Gaussian Plume.ipynb`, which is supported by a python module `plot_gauss.py`.
